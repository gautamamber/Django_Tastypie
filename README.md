# Django_Tastypie
**What Is Tastypie?**
 Tastypie is a webservice API framework for Django. It provides a convenient, yet powerful and highly customizable abstraction for creating REST-style interfaces.

Tastypie makes exposing your models easy, but gives you full control over what you expose, letting you abstract away the database as much as needed. Tastypie also makes it easy to integrate with non-ORM data sources.
